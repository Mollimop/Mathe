# quadratic function
This is a Java class that lets you create a quadratic function either using a, b and c (for a*xÂ² + b*x + c) or three points on the functions graph. Whenn initialized it will create its own zeroes and vertex and you can get the y-values for the entered x-values (it is also possible to generate y-values using start, step, end). 
The class is surrounded by some GUI stuff, (the actual class lives in quadratic_functions -> src -> quadratischeFunktionen -> QuadraticFunction.java)
